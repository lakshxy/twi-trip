Summary of what we did:
Removed Replit and Neon dependencies.
Updated the backend to use the standard pg driver and Drizzle ORM for local PostgreSQL.
Fixed Windows compatibility issues with environment variables and server binding.
Ensured your .env is loaded and the database connection works.
If you need any more help—such as adding features, fixing bugs, or deploying your app—just let me know. Happy coding!
